Add repository
	- add repository manually at the github homepage


Commit something
	$ git add README		--> Stages your file, adding it to the list of files to be committed
	$ git commit -m 'comment'	--> Commits your files, adding the message "commit"


Push commit
	$ git remote add origin https://github.com/TiKunze/Hello-World.git  	--> Creates a remote named "origin" pointing at your GitHub repository
	$ git push origin master		--> Sends your commits in the "master" branch to GitHub


Fork a repository
	- Fork a project at the GitHub website
	
	- Clone your fork
		$ git clone https://github.com/TiKunze/Spoon-Knife.git   --> Clones your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal
	
	- Configure remotes (default remote is 'origin', original repository needs to be named 'upstream'
		$ cd Spoon-Knife 
		$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git ---> Assigns the original repository to a remote called "upstream"
		$ git fetch upstream		--> Pulls in changes not present in your local repository, without modifying your files


Push Commits
	$ git push origin master	--> Pushes commits to your remote repository stored on GitHub


Pull in upstream changes (add updates to your fork, push commit before)
	$ git fetch upstream
	$ git merge upstream/master 	--> Merges any changes fetched into your working files
